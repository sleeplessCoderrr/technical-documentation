            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, you can design web pages with images that move, or objects that react to user input, or objects that create audio or video playback.</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, on the server, JavaScript can be used to read files from the file system, or to provide a web service that other applications can use.</li>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
            <li>Good knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page.</li>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java, JavaScript is dynamically typed and loosely-coupled. JavaScript is a prototype-based language which means that objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype. JavaScript is also a high-level language, which means that it has a clear and concise syntax that is easy to read and write.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a language that is also object-oriented, but it does not have classes. JavaScript uses prototypes to define properties and methods for objects. JavaScript is a language that is also functional, but it does not support functional programming features.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It can be used to create a web page that reacts to user input, or to create a web page that updates in real-time. JavaScript is also used to create web applications that are interactive and dynamic.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, you can write your first "Hello, World!" program:</p>
            <code>
                function greetMe() {
                    alert("Hello, World!");
                }
            </code>
            <p>Select the code snippet above and click the button labeled "Run" in the top right of the code editor. You will see a popup message with the text "Hello, World!".</p>
            <p>You can also write a script in the console of the browser's developer tools. To do this, open the browser's developer tools, select the "Console" tab, and type the following code:</p>
            <code>
                console.log("Hello, World!");
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. For example, the following are all valid identifiers:</p>
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>Undefined</li>
            <li>Null</li>
